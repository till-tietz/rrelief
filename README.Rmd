rrelief allows you to conveniently build visually appealing and informative maps with ggplot.
Using this package you can now easily visualize data over a shaded relief background without 
masking the relief.
This package heavily relies on the amazing raster (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=raster),
sf (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf) and 
exactextractr (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=exactextractr) packages and simply provides some convenient wrappers to integrate your normal workflow to accomplish this task into three functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rrelief from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("till-tietz/rrelief")
```
## Usage

This quick example will hopefully help to illustrate the general rrelief workflow, show what the package can do 
and get you started on making some nice maps. 
For this example we'll be using some voting district data for the state of Washington from (https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html),
as well as some elevation data for the north western United States from 
(http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/srtmdata/).


```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(rrelief)

#loading census_tract shape file as an sf object and adding a random variable
voting_districts <- sf::st_read("cb_2018_53_sldu_500k.shp")
voting_districts <- sf::st_transform(voting_districts, crs = 4326)
voting_districts[,"var"] <- runif(nrow(voting_districts), 0,100)

#loading .tif elevation files and merging them into one raster 
files <- list.files(recursive=TRUE, pattern=".tif$")
raster <- rrelief::generate.dem(raster.files = files, map.data = voting_districts, aggregate = 3)

#running rrelief keeping the crs projection at 4326
rrelief_output <- rrelief::overlay.relief(map.data = voting_districts, variables = c("var"),
                                          elevation.raster = raster, make.hillshade = TRUE, 
                                          coordinate.system = NULL, altitude = 45, azimuth = 270,
                                          z.factor = 10)

```

overlay.relief returns a data.frame of points with their respective hill-shade and variable values. 

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
rrelief_output <- readRDS("./man/figures/rrelief_output.rds")
knitr::kable(rrelief_output[c(1:10),])
```

Now you can simply create your base map with generate.map.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

map <- generate.map(data = rrelief_output, x = "x", y = "y", hillshade = "value",
                    variable = "var", coordinate.system = 4326)
```

You can further customize your base map with all the ggplot options you know and love. 
Let's add a slightly more compelling colour scheme and nicer legend. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

map +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(alpha = 0.8) +
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(title = "Random Variable",
                                label.position = "bottom",
                                frame.colour = "black",
                                barwidth = 10,
                                barheight = 1,
                                title.vjust = 1))
```
