# rrelief

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

rrelief allows you to conveniently build visually appealing and informative maps with ggplot.
Using this package you can now easily visualize data over a shaded relief background without 
masking the relief.
This package heavily relies on the amazing raster (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=raster),
sf (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf) and 
exactextractr (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=exactextractr) packages and simply provides a convenient wrapper to integrate your normal workflow to accomplish this task using these packages into one function.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rrelief from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("till-tietz/rrelief")
```
## Usage

This quick example will hopefully help to illustrate the general rrelief workflow, show what the package can do 
and get you started on making some nice maps. 
For this example we'll be using some census tract data for the state of Washington from (https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html),
as well as some elevation data for the north western United States from 
(http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/srtmdata/).

(If it is clear from looking at your map.data sf that many observations have the same variable values you might wish to merge them into one polygon
with sf::st_union() to cut down the run-time of overlay.relief)


```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(rrelief)

#loading census_tract shape file as an sf object
census_tracts <- sf::st_read("cb_2018_53_tract_500k.shp")
census_tracts <- sf::st_transform(census_tracts, crs = 4326)

#loading .tif elevation files as raster files and merging them into one raster 
files <- list.files(recursive=TRUE, pattern=".tif$")
rasters_list <- sapply(files, raster::raster)
names(rasters_list) <- NULL
rasters_list$fun <- mean
raster <- do.call(raster::mosaic, rasters_list)
raster::crs(raster) <- "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0" 
raster <- raster::crop(raster, census_tracts)

#adding some random variables to the census tracts so we have something to map
census_tracts[,"random_var_cont"] <- sample(seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 0.01), size = nrow(census_tracts), replace = TRUE)
census_tracts[,"random_var_cat"] <- sample(c(0,1, NA), size = nrow(census_tracts), replace = TRUE)

#running rrelief keeping the crs projection at 
rrelief_output <- overlay.relief(map.data = census_tracts, variables = c("random_var_cont", "random_var_cat"),
                                 elevation.raster = raster, make.hillshade = TRUE, 
                                 coordinate.system = NULL, altitude = 45, azimuth = 270, z.factor = 10)

```

overlay.relief returns a data.frame of points (defined by x and y coordinates) with their respective hill-shade (layer) and variable values. 

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
rrelief_output <- readRDS("C:/Users/ttiet/Desktop/rrelief_data/rrelief_test_out.rds")
knitr::kable(rrelief_output[c(1:10),c(1:5)])
```

Now you can simply create your base map with generate.map.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

map <- generate.map(data = rrelief_output, x = "x", y = "y", hillshade = "value",
                    variable = "random_var_cont", coordinate.system = 4326)
```

You can further customize your base map with all the ggplot options you know and love. 
Let's add a slightly more compelling colour scheme and nicer legend. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

map +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(alpha = 0.8) +
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(title = "Random Variable",
                                label.position = "bottom",
                                frame.colour = "black",
                                barwidth = 10,
                                barheight = 1,
                                title.vjust = 1))
```
